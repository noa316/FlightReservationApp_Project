# FlightReservationApp_Project
This was a Project I finished for my Software Design class where I created an Android App that acts as a Flight Reservation Simulator.

Otter Airways Flight Reservation System:

This is a Project done on Android Studio, mimicking a Flight reservation Android App. User’s are able to make an account, log in/log out of their account, and are able to search for flights and reserve flights if they have enough room for the amount of seats the user wants. The user can see how much their reservation will cost and they can also cancel before/after making a reservation. More explanation including graphs, use cases and screenshots below. 

Technologies: Java, Room Database, Android Studio.

Objective:
· Implement an object-oriented android application with multiple activities using RoomDB.
· Read and understand application requirements presented in the form of use cases.
· There are 15 test cases for this application. Below is a summary of the 15 test cases along with 15 screen shots showing that my application works for each test.
· The application should starts with some pre-set usernames and passwords and a special admin userid “!admiM2”.
· The application also starts with the 5 pre-defined flights.
